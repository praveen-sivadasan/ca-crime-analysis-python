    "lead_paragraph": "California, with the nation's worst air, will open hearings today to develop standards for cleaner-burning gasoline. Not suprisingly, most oil companies hate the idea. But one, ARCO, is arguing vigorously that the standards state engineers have proposed are too lax. The argument among the brethren of the oil fraternity adds a curious twist to a complicated debate over clean air.
