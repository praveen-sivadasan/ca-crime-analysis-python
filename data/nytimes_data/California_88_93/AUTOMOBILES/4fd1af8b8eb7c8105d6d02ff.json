    "lead_paragraph": "The clean-air car of the future might operate like the five experimental Volvo 940 sedans now undergoing testing by California's South Coast Air Quality Management District. The cars burn a mixture of gasoline and methanol and have an electrically heated catalytic converter to treat the big blast of pollution that cars typically emit when a cold engine is started. Executives at Volvo Cars of North America say the vehicles are the only flexible-fuel, heated-catalyst cars on the road today. California air pollution control officials report that the Volvos appear to be the cleanest liquid-fueled vehicles they have ever tested. Preliminary tests indicate that emissions from the cars meet even California's upcoming standards for ultra-low emissions.",
