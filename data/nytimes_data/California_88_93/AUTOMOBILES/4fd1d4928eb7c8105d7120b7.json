    "lead_paragraph": "California state smog officials and the Ford Motor Company unveiled two new automobile models today that they said were the cleanest-running cars ever approved for mass production in the world. They were updated versions of the Ford Escort and the Mercury Tracer, engineered to meet pollutant emission standards California has set for 1997 models, four years ahead of schedule. The new cars are to go on sale at Ford dealers in California starting May 21, when the 1993 models are introduced.",
