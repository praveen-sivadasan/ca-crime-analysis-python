    "lead_paragraph": "State regulators today seized the California insurance subsidiary of the First Capital Holdings Corporation after an attempt by Citibank, the troubled company's main lender, to force it into involuntary bankruptcy.

First Capital Holdings and its insurance units have been stung in recent months by defaults in their portfolios of \"junk bonds\" and by consumers' fears about the insurers' ability to honor their commitments.",
