    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Being a casual bicycle tourist myself, I was excited to read Dianna Waggoner's \"Cycling Down California's North Coast\" (July 25). That is, until I found that I was one of those \"other riders,\" something Ms. Waggoner describes ungenerously as a \"pack burro.\" Yes, one of those unfortunate few, cursed to struggle and wobble with 25 to 40 pounds of \"stuff\" while the Ms. Waggoners of this world are free to ride like birds, carrying only windbreakers and credit cards. I read Ms. Waggoner's article upon returning from my most recent tour: through the Catskills to Ithaca, N.Y. Packed neatly in my saddlebags and on my rack, I carried about 35 pounds of \"stuff,\" including food, a tent, a stove and fuel, and averaged 70 miles a day. .",
