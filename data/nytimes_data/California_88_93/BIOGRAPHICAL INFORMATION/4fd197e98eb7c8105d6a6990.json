    "lead_paragraph": "At 85, EDMUND G. (PAT) BROWN might be the oldest new prosecutor ever. But the former Governor of California wasn't taking a new job when he was sworn in Thursday as a Deputy District Attorney in Los Angeles County. Rather, he took the oath so he could swear in KATHLEEN BROWN , his daughter, as the state Treasurer. When Ms. Brown asked that her father do the honors on Monday in Sacramento, IRA REINER , the Los Angeles County District Attorney, agreed to make Mr. Brown an unpaid temporary prosecutor for the inauguration. California law requires that the swearing in of a state official be done by an acting judge or prosecutor. Ms. Brown also follows her brother, JERRY BROWN , in state government; he is a former Governor.",
