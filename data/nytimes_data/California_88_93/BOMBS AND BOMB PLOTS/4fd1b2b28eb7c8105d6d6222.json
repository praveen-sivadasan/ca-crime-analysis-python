    "lead_paragraph": "A note denouncing Gov. Pete Wilson's statements linking immigrants to the state budget crisis apparently accompanied a package bomb sent to the Governor's office over the weekend, The San Francisco Chronicle reported today. Quoting sources it did not identify, the newspaper said the note's writer had expressed anger over comments the Governor had made tying the widening gap between state revenue and expenditures to people moving to California and the increased need for public services like welfare benefits. The Governor had been criticized for such comments, which some interpret as derogatory toward immigrants.",
