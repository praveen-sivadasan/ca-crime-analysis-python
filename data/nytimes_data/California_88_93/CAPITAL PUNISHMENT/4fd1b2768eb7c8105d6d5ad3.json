    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: \"The Court's Rush to Kill\" (editorial, April 22), on California's execution of Robert Alton Harris, boggles my mind. As you report in your news pages the same day, the crime was committed in 1978; the conviction was upheld by the California Supreme Court in 1981; district courts rejected habeas corpus petitions and were upheld by appeals courts; additional hearings were held in the intervening years. And now, in 1992, you talk about a rush to kill! There is certainly much room for difference of opinion among men of good will on the death sentence. But to call an execution a rush to kill after 14 years of legal maneuvering, is out of line. ALFRED N. GREENBERG New York, April 22, 1992",
