    "lead_paragraph": "California is so eager to keep its executions off television that the state has shut out all the press, prompting two justifiable counterattacks. The ban has been challenged in Federal District Court in San Francisco by KQED, the public television station, and in the Legislature, with a bill that would permit filming of executions, though only with the condemned person's consent. These rapid responses reflect justifiable outrage. The state has sequestered an important, controversial government process without any compelling reason. That seems an abridgment of the First Amendment, one the courts and the Legislature would be wise to strike down.",
