    "lead_paragraph": "A man whose daughter suddenly recalled his slaying of her playmate more than two decades ago and then reported him to the police was sentenced today to the maximum punishment of life in prison. He will be eligible to apply for parole in seven years. The 51-year-old defendant, George Thomas Franklin, a retired firefighter, showed no emotion as Judge Thomas McGinn Smith of San Mateo County Superior Court called him a \"depraved and wicked man.\" The judge then handed down the punishment for the first-degree murder of Susan Nason, 8 years old, the childhood playmate of Mr. Franklin's daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker.",
