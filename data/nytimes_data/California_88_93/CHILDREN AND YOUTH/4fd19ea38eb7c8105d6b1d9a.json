    "lead_paragraph": "A youth has been accused of 20 misdemeanor counts of vandalism and trespassing in what the City Attorney calls the nation's worst case of graffiti damage. Daniel Ramos, 18 years old, was charged on Wednesday with painting \"Chaka\" on 10,000 sites in Southern California, causing about $500,000 in damage. The word is scrawled on utility poles and traffic signs, or lovingly painted in rainbow-colored murals on buildings and retaining walls. The charges are in addition to 28 misdemeanor counts filed against Mr. Ramos two days after his arrest on Nov. 28.",
