    "lead_paragraph": "A chart with an article last Sunday about the troubles of the public university systems in California misstated the student-to-faculty ratios and the faculty totals at California State University. For the 1966-67 academic year, the ratio was 16.9 to 1, with 7,779 faculty members; for the 1990-91 year, the ratio was 18.4 to 1, with 15,099 faculty members. These figures are adjusted by the university to convert part-time faculty members to their full-time equivalents. The chart also misstated the growth in the student population for that period. It was 112 percent, not 115 percent.",
