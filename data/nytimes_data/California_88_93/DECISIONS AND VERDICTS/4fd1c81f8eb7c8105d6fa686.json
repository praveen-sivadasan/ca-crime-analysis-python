    "lead_paragraph": "A jury here today found the California Superintendent of Public Instruction, Bill Honig, guilty of violating the state's conflict-of-interest law by steering state contracts that benefited a nonprofit group headed by his wife. The four felony counts on which Mr. Honig was convicted after a trial that began on Jan. 11 carry a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison. In addition the 55-year-old state schools chief, who had achieved national prominence for his efforts to overhaul California's approach to education, was immediately suspended from performing official duties and will be removed from his elected office when he is sentenced. Sentencing was scheduled for Feb. 26.",
