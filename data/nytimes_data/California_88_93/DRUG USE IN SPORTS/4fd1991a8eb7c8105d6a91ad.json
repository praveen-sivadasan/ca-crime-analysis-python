    "lead_paragraph": "Patrick Valenzuela, who rode Sunday Silence to victories in the 1989 Kentucky Derby and Preakness, was suspended indefinitely yesterday by the board of stewards at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif. Valenzuela, who served a 60-day suspension late last year after testing positive for cocaine, was suspended pending complete medical and psychological evaluations to determine his fitness for a license, the board said in its ruling yesterday. The suspension bars Valenzuela, 28 years old, from all California race tracks. Valenzuela, one of the nation's leading jockeys in recent years, has not ridden since he phoned in sick for his mounts on the California Cup racing card at Santa Anita on Nov. 3. The stewards requested that Valenzuela take a blood test, but he refused. Attorneys for the jockey said blood and urine samples taken on Nov. 7 showed no traces of illegal drugs in Valenzuela's system. (AP)",
