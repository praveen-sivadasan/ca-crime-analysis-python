    "lead_paragraph": "Southern California's odds of being walloped by disastrous earthquakes -- including the so-called Big One -- will be recalculated because of two major jolts in June, officials said Wednesday. Scientists believe the odds were increased by changes in underground stress from the 7.5- and 6.6-magnitude quakes that struck Landers and Big Bear, 80 to 100 miles east-northeast of Los Angeles, on June 28. But scientists don't know how much greater the odds are now.",
