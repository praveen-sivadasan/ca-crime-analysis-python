Yet for two months it has had to pay some employees and many bills with i.o.u.'s, and its credit rating has plummeted. The episode has embarrassed California's politicians. It also challenges them to a higher order of statesmanship the next time around. Yesterday's $57.4 billion budget agreement may well improve the state's credit rating and its investment climate. It may also be sufficient to finance hard-pressed schools, health clinics and other public programs. But the margin for error is slim.
