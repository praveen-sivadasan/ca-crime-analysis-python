    "lead_paragraph": "President-elect Clinton promises to fix America's ruinously expensive health care system with managed competition. That's absolutely the right idea. Managed competition would encourage the use of large health maintenance organizations -- and force them to compete. That's the way to preserve quality and control costs without having to hire an army of bureaucrats. Mr. Clinton, meet Mr. Clinton. Almost without pausing for breath, the President-elect also promises something else, ominously contradictory. Government, he says, should control costs by setting a limit on total health expenditures, what he calls a global budget, enforced with price controls.",
