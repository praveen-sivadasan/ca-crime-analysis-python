    "lead_paragraph": "When I was in Tokyo last month, they asked me what the possibility was that I would run for President. I told them that question was too easy. If they had asked me, \"Do you think there is a possibility that while the Governor of New York is in Japan there will be an earthquake and a typhoon in two days?\" I would have said, \"Not likely.\" But of course -- there was an earthquake and a typhoon in those two days. So the unlikely sometimes happens. But I can't get away with this cuteness routine forever. I've been saying I have no plans to run, and no plans to make plans, but now it's a year to Election Day and it's time to stop playing Hamlet and start playing for keeps.",
