    "lead_paragraph": "Senator Alan Cranston's decision not to run for re-election radically alters the chemistry of California politics, and Democrats and Republicans the length of the state began testing the political waters today. Coming two days after Californians elected their Republican Senator, Pete Wilson, as governor, Mr. Cranston's decision sets up two free-for-all Senate races in 1992.
