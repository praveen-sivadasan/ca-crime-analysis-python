    "lead_paragraph": "Just four years after Federal wildlife officials rounded up the last wild California condors in a Dunkirk-like evacuation to save the species from extinction, they have decided to start restoring the giant ancient birds to the wild. The decision is a milestone for what is probably the most ambitious and costly effort ever undertaken to replenish a nearly extinct species. Two condor chicks are to be released in September or October into a rugged mountainous sanctuary in Los Padres National Forest, about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. If that first step is successful, the hope is ultimately to create two separate wild populations of about 100 birds each.",
