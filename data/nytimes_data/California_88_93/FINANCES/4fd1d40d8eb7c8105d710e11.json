    "lead_paragraph": "A judge on Tuesday ordered this budget-deadlocked state to resume paying wages to the workers who provide in-home care to 179,000 disabled Californians. The administration of Gov. Pete Wilson said it would appeal the order but would comply with it in the meantime. Edd Fong, a spokesman for State Comptroller Gray Davis, said he expected that i.o.u.'s, with which the state has been paying its own employees since the last fiscal year ended two months ago, would be mailed to the 155,000 home-care workers today.",
