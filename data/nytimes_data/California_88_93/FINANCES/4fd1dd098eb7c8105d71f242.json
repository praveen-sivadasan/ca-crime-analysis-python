    "lead_paragraph": "The inability of California to pay all its bills in cash is a black mark against its reputation in financial markets, but there is a silver lining for people and businesses who are issued i.o.u.'s instead of cash. If the recipients of the i.o.u.'s hold the check-like pieces of paper, the state has promised to pay a 5 percent interest rate, which is much higher than the annual rate they could earn on a short-term bank deposit. If the i.o.u.'s are deposited or cashed at a bank, the bank will receive the 5 percent rate.",
