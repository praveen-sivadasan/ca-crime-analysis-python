    "lead_paragraph": "His name is Harold L. Arbit, but maybe it should be Arbiter. Mr. Arbit is playing a powerful role, though often behind the scenes, in trying to forge a compromise between environmentalists and lumber companies on logging in California forests. If compromise legislation is enacted here, it could become a model for other timber states. Mr. Arbit, who runs Concord Capital Management, a portfolio management company in San Mateo, Calif., has been using his personal wealth to almost single-handedly provide financial backing for the environmentalists. That has given him a powerful voice in decision-making.",
