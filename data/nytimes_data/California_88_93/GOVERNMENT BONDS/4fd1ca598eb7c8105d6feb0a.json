    "lead_paragraph": "The State of California yesterday priced for sale to the public a $118.4 million bond issue through underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. The proceeds will be used to refund in advance previous debt sold when interest rates were higher. The offering, which was repriced to yield slightly less because of good investor demand, produced a maximum yield of about 5.385 percent for an electric refunding revenue bond due in 2013. The taxable equivalent of that yield is about 7.80 percent for investors in the 31 percent Federal tax bracket.",
