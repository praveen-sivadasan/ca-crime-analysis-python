    "lead_paragraph": "A year after his car tumbled down a California embankment in what authorities described as a drunken-driving accident that left WILLIE SHOEMAKER a quadriplegic, the former jockey has filed a damage suit against the state, asserting that he was not drunk at the time and that state negligence was to blame for the accident. In a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Shoemaker and his wife, CINDY, the couple charge that the state did not install guard rails or a sign warning of a dangerous road condition. Shoemaker seeks $20 million and his wife wants $5 million to compensate for the loss of her 60-year-old husband's services.",
