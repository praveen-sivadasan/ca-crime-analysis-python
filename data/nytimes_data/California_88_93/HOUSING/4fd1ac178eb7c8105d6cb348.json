    "lead_paragraph": "The California Public Employees Retirement System voted Tuesday to increase the financing for a new program to spur construction of single-family homes in California. The retirement system said it would increase by $150 million, to $375 million, its investment in partnerships set up to give a boost to the state's recession-battered construction business. The system, known as Calpers, voted last month to invest $225 million in the program, the first time a public pension fund has invested directly in the large-scale building of single-family houses.",
