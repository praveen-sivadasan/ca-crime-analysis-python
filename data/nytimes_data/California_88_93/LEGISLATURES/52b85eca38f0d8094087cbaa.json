    "lead_paragraph": "The problem of drawing new maps for California's 1992 Congressional and legislative elections has been tossed to the California Supreme Court after the Legislature sustained Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of reapportionment plans. Democratic attempts to override the Republican Governor's vetoes failed Monday on votes of 22 to 10 in the Senate and 41 to 32 in the Assembly.
