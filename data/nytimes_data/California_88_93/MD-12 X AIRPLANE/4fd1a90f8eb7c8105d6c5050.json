    "lead_paragraph": "The McDonnell Douglas Corporation said it had run out of room to expand its Douglas Aircraft Company operations here and might have to produce its next-generation passenger jet outside California. The company said it might move the $3 billion MD-12X jet project to a state that offered more incentives. \"The probability is that we will go elsewhere,\" said Donald Snyder, general manager of the MD-12X program. A company spokesman, Don Hanson, said McDonnell was not considering shutting down its Douglas unit in Long Beach. \"What we're talking about is a new facility\" for the MD-12X, he said. McDonnell Douglas' board will decide by August where to manufacture the MD-12X, The Los Angeles Times reported.",
