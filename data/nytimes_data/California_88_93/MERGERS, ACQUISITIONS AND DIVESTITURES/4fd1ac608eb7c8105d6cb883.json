    "lead_paragraph": "A judge in Los Angeles gave the go-ahead yesterday to a plan to sell the remaining assets from California's largest failed insurance company to a team of French investors. Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin ordered California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi to proceed with his plan to sell the remaining assets and policies from Los Angeles-based Executive Life Insurance Company to a group of investors headed by Altus Finance, a unit of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank. The judge overruled all objections to the plan from Executive Life policyholders, including a proposal to rescind a controversial junk bond sale and a provision that may limit their ability to object publicly to the sale.(AP)",
