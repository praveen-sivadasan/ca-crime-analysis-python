    "lead_paragraph": "WITH the BankAmerica Corporation having agreed to buy the Security Pacific Corporation, attention in California banking circles is shifting to a deal that has not yet happened: an acquisition of First Interstate Bancorp by Wells Fargo & Company. Wells Fargo and First Interstate have not given any firm indication that they are interested in a merger, and it is unclear whether the two companies have even held any discussions.
