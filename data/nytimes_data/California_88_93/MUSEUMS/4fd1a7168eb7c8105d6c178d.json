    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: I was surprised that J. M. Fenster's otherwise comprehensive survey of \"The Huntington's Triple Treasures\" (Travel, Nov. 25) neglected to mention the new permanent exhibition and study center devoted to the California architects Charles and Henry Greene. Housed in the Virginia Steele Scott Gallery (not as was stated in the article the Steele Gallery), the exhibit and library (known as the Greene and Greene Center for the Study of the Arts and Crafts Movement in America) are joint efforts of the Huntington and the Gamble House of the University of Southern California. A dining room and stairhall have been re-created, and furnishings from many of the Greene brothers' Arts and Crafts houses are on display. The viewer will find some of the most exquisitely crafted American furniture produced in the 20th century. JAMES E. BENJAMIN New York, N.Y.",
