    "lead_paragraph": "A coalition of editors and busi ness managers of seven student publications in California is lobbying in Sacramento for a bill exempting free student publications from a new sales tax that the group says could damage or even bankrupt some student newspapers. The new law, which went into effect July 15, levies a 7.25 percent sales tax on paper and ink for all free publications in the state.
