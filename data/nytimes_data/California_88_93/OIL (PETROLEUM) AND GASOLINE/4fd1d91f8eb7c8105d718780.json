    "lead_paragraph": "After laboring for decades under the nation's toughest air-quality rules, companies in Southern California now face a daunting new challenge: proving that they can figure out on their own how best to clean up the nation's worst smog. Under a plan that regional air-quality regulators approved earlier this month, Southern California will scrap most of its cumbersome rules for oil refineries and other large industrial polluters. Instead, the regulators are introducing a radical new free-market approach. Companies will still face strict quotas for reducing emissions. But they will be free to satisfy these limits in almost any way they see fit -- even by buying the right to pollute from another company that has surpassed its cleanup quota.",
