    "lead_paragraph": "In a direct appeal to the Republican conservative base two weeks before the California Presidential primary, Vice President Dan Quayle said today that the Los Angeles riots were the result of a \"poverty of values\" in the inner cities and that the nation should show no sympathy to those who joined in the civil unrest. Seeking to shore up President Bush's support in the most populous state, and to lay groundwork for his own political future, Mr. Quayle appeared before the Commonwealth Club of California to deliver the sort of tub-thumping message that conservatives, including some of the Vice President's supporters, contend is lacking from Mr. Bush's oratory. Transition to Middle Class? \"I believe the lawless social anarchy which we saw is directly related to the breakdown of family structure, personal responsibility and social order in too many areas of our society,\" Mr. Quayle said in his first trip to California since the rioting, which left 58 dead and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage.",
