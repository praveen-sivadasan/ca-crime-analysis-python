    "lead_paragraph": "Throwing a bone to California, an economically depressed and politically crucial state, Defense Secretary Les Aspin has decided to spare two military installations there that had been on the armed services' list of those that should close, senior Pentagon officials said today. But Mr. Aspin, ignoring pleas from dozens of lawmakers and communities nationwide, plans to recommend on Friday that about 30 other major installations be closed and as many as 150 other depots and smaller sites be consolidated or reduced. Acknowledging the importance of the base-closing issue, President Clinton visited a Maryland factory today and announced a plan to ease conversions from military to civilian manufacture.
