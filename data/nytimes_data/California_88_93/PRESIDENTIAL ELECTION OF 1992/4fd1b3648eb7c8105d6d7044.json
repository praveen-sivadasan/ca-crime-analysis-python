    "lead_paragraph": "Although only about half of California voters know enough about him to express an opinion, Ross Perot would run neck-and-neck with President Bush here and slightly ahead of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas if the election were held now, according to a Los Angeles Times poll published today.
