    "lead_paragraph": "The Mercury General Corporation said today that it had agreed to pay rebates totaling $45.8 million to 266,000 automobile insurance policyholders in California under the terms of a much-contested initiative passed by the state's voters in 1988. Mercury is the second large insurer in the state to drop its opposition to the rate-cutting initiative, Proposition 103, and the first publicly traded company to do so. Last year the Automobile Club of Southern California rebated $104 million to half a million customers.",
