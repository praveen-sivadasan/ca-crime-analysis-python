    "lead_paragraph": "MATANZAS CREEK WINERY, a Sonoma Valley estate, has introduced a chardonnay that carries a suggested retail price of $70, a record for a California white wine. The wine, Journey, comes from the 1990 vintage. Matanzas Creek produced only 212 six-bottle cases of regular-size bottles and 82 six-bottle cases of magnums (the magnum costs $140). Most have been tightly rationed to selected retailers and restaurateurs around the country.",
