    "lead_paragraph": "By filing petitions bearing more than one million signatures, Gov. Pete Wilson has placed his referendum for welfare cuts and new budget powers on the November ballot, nearly two months ahead of the deadline. Mr. Wilson's referendum question proposes to cut welfare benefits by up to 25 percent, limit new residents to benefits they would be getting in their former home states and give his office more authority to cut spending in financial emergencies. He also wants to cut pay for legislators and the Governor if they fail to adopt a budget on time.",
