    "lead_paragraph": "Two environmental groups charged in a lawsuit today that many American-made kitchen faucets leach dangerous levels of lead into drinking water and pose a significant public health risk. The lawsuit, which lawyers describe as the most broad-based action brought under California's stringent antitoxic law, was filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Law Foundation. It names more than 25 manufacturers whose products were found to have leached from 6 to 250 times as much lead as allowed under the law.",
