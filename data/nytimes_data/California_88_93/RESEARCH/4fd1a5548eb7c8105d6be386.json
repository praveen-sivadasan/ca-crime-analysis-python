    "lead_paragraph": "IN one of the largest experiments yet in using a control group to test the efficacy of a public policy, the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (M.D.R.C.) is evaluating a California program designed to help welfare recipients get off welfare. While earlier Federal laws encouraged states to funnel recipients into work, the Family Support Act of 1988 demands more ambitious efforts to wean the chronically dependent from welfare. California's version, the Greater Avenues to Independence Program, is being evaluated with experiments in six counties, using randomly selected individual controls for comparison. And the research organization has already published voluminous information about what happened to 33,000 individuals in the first year of testing.",
