    "lead_paragraph": "California has had more than its share of savings and loan fraud and mismanagement. But a robust real estate market has largely spared savings institutions here from the crippling losses suffered by their counterparts in depressed housing markets in Texas, Colorado, Arizona and the Northeast -- at least until now. No one is predicting a Texas-style collapse in California.

California is home to nine of the country's ten largest institutions and accounts for nearly a quarter of all savings and loan assets.",
