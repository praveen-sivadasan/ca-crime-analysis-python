    "lead_paragraph": "A former State Senator was sentenced in Federal District Court on Friday to five years in prison for corruption, but the judge said the sentence could be reduced if the defendant, Alan Robbins, continued cooperating with investigators. He was also fined $250,100 and ordered to pay $225,000 to the developer from whom he had admitted extorting money.

He pleaded guilty in December and implicated several other people.",
