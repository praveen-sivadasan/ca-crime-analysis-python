    "lead_paragraph": "On a spring day nine months ago Colin Ferguson walked into a hunting and fishing store in Southern California to buy the 15-shot semiautomatic pistol that the police say he used Tuesday evening in his deadly march through a Long Island commuter train. He selected a bulky Ruger P-89, a weapon designed for the military, gave his real name, supplied a California driver's license with a Long Beach address, affirmed that he was not a convicted felon or a mental patient and was told he could pick up the weapon after a waiting period of 16 days. Fifteen days were imposed by the state of California and one was added for good measure by the gun store, Turner's Outdoorsman, which has 14 outlets.",
