    "lead_paragraph": "Pfizer Inc. said yesterday that it had won a round in its legal battle to prevent out-of-state residents from suing in California over its reportedly defective artificial heart valve. Pfizer said the California Supreme Court on Thursday had ordered a state appeals court to hear the company's argument that 16 out-of-state plaintiffs with Pfizer Shiley heart valves should be forced to sue in their home states. A lower court ruled last year that the heart valve recipients could sue in California, where the valves were made from 1979 to 1986. A total of 86,000 heart patients worldwide were implanted with the valve. Pfizer set up a $300 million reserve in the fourth quarter of 1991 that it says should cover costs related to all Shiley lawsuits.",
