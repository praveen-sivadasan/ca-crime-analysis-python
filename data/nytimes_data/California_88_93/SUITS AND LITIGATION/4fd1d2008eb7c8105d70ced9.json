    "lead_paragraph": "The United States Supreme Court agreed today to hear a suit, brought by R. H. Macy & Company, asserting that California's Proposition 13 unfairly assesses strikingly higher taxes on newly purchased property. The suit challenges the taxpayers' revolt proposition, which was a 1978 amendment to the California Constitution. Proposition 13 set local property taxes at 1 percent of assessed valuation, rolled back assessments to 1975 levels and limited subsequent increases to 2 percent a year.",
