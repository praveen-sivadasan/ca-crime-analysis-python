    "lead_paragraph": "Economists say salvation for California's staggering economy lies in small entrepreneurial companies like the Invitrogen Corporation here. A maker of gene-isolation kits and other products for biomedical research, it has shrugged off recession, expanding from 20 employees in 1989 to 105 today in a 30,000 square-foot plant amid tall pines in the La Jolla area. But now that Invitrogen stands ready to expand even further, its brash young leaders may move all or part of the company to Oregon or Washington State. And therein lies the major question facing once-booming California -- home for one in eight Americans -- as it struggles through its longest economic slump since World War II: Is it too late to recapture the spirit that made California golden and prevent even the few bright spots like San Diego's thriving biotechnology industry from going dim too?",
