    "lead_paragraph": "EVERY year at this time, Wine and Spirits, a consumer magazine for wine enthusiasts, publishes a survey of what people are drinking in restaurants.

The current report, in the April issue, indicates that Americans are continuing their tried and true wine-drinking patterns. Chardonnay is still the all-out favorite wine. Make that California chardonnay: of the 15 top chardonnay producers cited in the poll, 13 are California wineries. Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards is in first place, Kendall-Jackson Vineyard second and Robert Mondavi Winery third.",
