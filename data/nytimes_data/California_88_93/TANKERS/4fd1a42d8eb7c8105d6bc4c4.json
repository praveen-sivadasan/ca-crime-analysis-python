    "lead_paragraph": "A state agency today approved an oil industry plan to use tankers for three years along the coastline north of Los Angeles. The decision comes after a decadelong standoff among oil producers, environmentalists and government officials over one of the nation's richest oil fields. The 7-to-4 vote by the California Coastal Commission permits the loading of up to 50,000 barrels of crude oil a day into tankers that will travel from the Point Arguello oil field off the coast near Gaviota to refineries in the Los Angeles area. Up to seven shipments a month will be allowed.",
