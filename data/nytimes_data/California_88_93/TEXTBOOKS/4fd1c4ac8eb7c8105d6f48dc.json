    "lead_paragraph": "I studied the textbook illustrations displayed in Robert Reinhold's article \"Class Struggle\" (Sept. 29), and it seems to me that Houghton Mifflin did a good job. A lecturer in American Indian studies complains, in the article, that the third-grade book \"trivialized Indian history\" and criticizes an illustration of how to build a \"medicine dance tent\" (\"It reduces our sun dance and medicine dance to a toilet-paper project\"). But how else can 8-year-olds learn something if it is not simple? I only wish that I had had textbooks like these seven years ago, when I was in the fourth grade. \"A Moment in Time\" looks colorful and exciting. It is unfortunate that many are already criticizing the textbooks. Let the children judge for themselves. AMY WU Thornwood, N.Y.",
