    "lead_paragraph": "The problem with texts is that they must tell the story of history from someone's viewpoint and that someone else's may be left out or misrepresented. Why not dispense with texts of history and let the students' own backgrounds provide the text? A project on diversity, allowing children in California and elsewhere to build on their own history, would be more conducive to learning than reading a text. Just think, the students could bring in their own bread and eat it together. Of course, without textbooks, students and teachers would have to research issues themselves. This takes more time than merely assigning (or reading) pages in a prepared text. EMILY A. REISNER Durham, N.C.
