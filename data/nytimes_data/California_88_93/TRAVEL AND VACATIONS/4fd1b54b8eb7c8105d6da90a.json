    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: I was delighted to read Katherine Bishop's article on our northern California youth hostels (\"Not for the Young Only,\" May 17) but dismayed to hear she had such a negative experience at the Eel River Hostel in Leggett. I'm a hostel fan from way back, even though I'm long past the youth stage. I've been going to Eel River every year since they opened, but not in February! The couples' cabins are Spartan at best and having to traipse to the bathroom by flashlight can be a drag. But this doesn't seem to matter in summer when you can smell the pine trees, admire the flowers, float down the river on inner tubes and relax in the sauna.",
