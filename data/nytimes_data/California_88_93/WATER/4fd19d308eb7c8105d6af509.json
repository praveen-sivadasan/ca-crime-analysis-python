    "lead_paragraph": "Southern California Edison will build 20 prototype \"houses of the future\" in the eastern suburbs of Los Angeles in 1991, the company said. The houses are designed so that water consumption will be reduced by 25 percent, electricity saved and the load factor of the utility's generating equipment increased.
