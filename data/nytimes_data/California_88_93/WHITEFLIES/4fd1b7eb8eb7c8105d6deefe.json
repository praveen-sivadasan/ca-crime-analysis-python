    "lead_paragraph": "THE whitefly that has destroyed more than a half billion dollars' worth of crops in California and other states is a different species than had been thought, scientists say, and the discovery could speed the search for a natural enemy to control the insect. Synthetic pesticides are largely ineffective in attacking the whitefly. Scientists previously believed that the sweet-potato whitefly was responsible for the crop damage, and they have been searching for the natural enemy, presumably a parasite, in the bodies of a number of strains of outwardly identical sweet-potato whiteflies collected from around the world. Typically, only one variety of parasite attaches itself to only one variety of whitefly.",
