    "lead_paragraph": "WHEN Georges de Latour, the founder of the Beaulieu Vineyard in the Napa Valley, tasted his first Private Reserve cabernet sauvignon, the 1936 vintage, he was reputed to have said, \"This is the wine I have been trying to make all my life.\" Tasting that same wine last Sunday, 54 years after it was made, one could still understand his enthusiasm.
