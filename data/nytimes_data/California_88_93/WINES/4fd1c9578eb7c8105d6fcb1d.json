    "lead_paragraph": "A DECADE AGO, A LITTLE-KNOWN BICOASTAL WINE RIVALRY developed that threatened to wreak serious harm on the country's fledgling program of wine appellations. Wine appellations, better known as the names of viticultural regions, define the area in which wines may be made. The Napa Valley is probably the country's best-known viticultural region. The Russian River, in Sonoma County, is another; so is the North Fork, on Long Island. In 1981, a group of wine growers in the Shenandoah Valley in Amador County, Calif., petitioned the Government to grant them a \"Shenandoah Valley\" viticultural appellation. Wineries in the original Shenandoah Valley, of Virginia, immediately filed a rival petition demanding that the appellation be granted only to them.",
