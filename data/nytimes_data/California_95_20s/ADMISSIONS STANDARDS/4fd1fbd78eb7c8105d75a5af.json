    "lead_paragraph": "As a clear beneficiary of affirmative-action policies in California (Stanford '87, U.C.L.A. Law '91), and as an admissions officer at a selective private institution, I found James Traub's article (May 2) on the future of race in admissions disturbing. The phenomenon described as ''cascading,'' which is called ''serious, but not tragic,'' is a terrible consequence of the elimination of affirmative action in California. No one denies that U.C. Riverside provides an excellent education. Neither can you deny that U.C.L.A. and Berkeley are likely to provide better opportunities in the long run.",
