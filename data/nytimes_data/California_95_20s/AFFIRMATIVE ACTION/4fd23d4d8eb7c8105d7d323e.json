    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: While your April 5 news article about the latest admissions figures for the University of California system focuses on minority racial and ethnic groups, it almost entirely ignores Asians. No mention is made of the fact, for instance, that Asians are now the largest group -- including whites -- admitted to the system's most competitive campuses. Nor does the article mention that 56 percent of those admitted into the system are now female.",
