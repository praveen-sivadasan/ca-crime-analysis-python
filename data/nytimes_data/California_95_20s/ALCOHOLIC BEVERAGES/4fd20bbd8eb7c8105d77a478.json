But don't tell that to Chuck Wagner Jr. Mr. Wagner is the president and winemaker at Caymus Vineyards in the Napa Valley in California. Someone sold him a bunch of roussanne vines a few years ago, and he was looking forward to making $75-a-bottle wines from them. Until someone else told him they were not roussanne at all but viognier. Now, Mr. Wagner is suing the seller for $7 million.",
