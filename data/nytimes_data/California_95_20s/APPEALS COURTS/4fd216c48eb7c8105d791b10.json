    "lead_paragraph": "Criticizing fellow Federal judges in unusually harsh language, a narrowly divided Supreme Court ruled today that the Federal appeals court in California had committed a ''grave abuse of discretion'' by intervening at the last minute to overturn a convicted murderer's 14-year-old death sentence. The prisoner, Thomas M. Thompson, whose appeals had been rejected twice by the United States Supreme Court and four times by the California Supreme Court, was scheduled for execution in less than two days when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invoked an unusual procedure last Aug. 3 to reopen its final judgment against him.",
