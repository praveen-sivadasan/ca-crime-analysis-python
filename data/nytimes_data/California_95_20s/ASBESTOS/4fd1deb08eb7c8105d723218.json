    "lead_paragraph": "The Supreme Court struck today for the first time against the Federal Government's aggressive use of forfeiture, ruling that a forfeiture intended as punishment is unconstitutional if the amount seized is ''grossly disproportional'' to the gravity of the offense. Applying that test in a sharply contested 5-to-4 ruling, the Court went on to declare that the Government could not constitutionally seize $357,144 in undeclared cash that a Los Angeles man and his family had tried to bring in their luggage on a flight to Cyprus. The money itself, intended to repay a family debt, was not the proceeds of a crime; the man's only crime was failing to obey a Federal law that requires reporting all currency being taken out of the country in excess of $10,000.",
    "abstract": "Supreme Court rules for first time against Federal Government's aggressive use of forfeiture, deciding by 5-4 vote that forfeiture intended as punishment is unconstitutional if amount seized is 'grossly disproportional' to gravity of offense; says Government could not Constitutionally seize $357,144 in undeclared cash that Los Angeles resident and wife tried to take out of country since money was intended to repay family debt and was not proceeds from crime; rules, 5-4, that illegally seized evidence, which would be barred by exclusionary rule from use by prosecution at criminal trial, can be used in parole revocation hearing; agrees to revisit issue last dealt with year ago when it rejected huge class-action settlement that had purported to resolve liability of 20 former asbestos manufacturers to workers who had been exposed to deadly substance but who had not yet become ill; turns down appeal by California challenging Congress's constitutional authority to bring disabled prison inmates within protections of Americans With Disabilities Act (M)",
