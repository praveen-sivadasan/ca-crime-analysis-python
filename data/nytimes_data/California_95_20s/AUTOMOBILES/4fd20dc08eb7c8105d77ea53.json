    "lead_paragraph": "THE Dodge Charger design study, introduced by DaimlerChrysler last week at the North American International Auto Show here, looks like a modern rendition of the 1960's muscle car from which it got its name. Under its long hood, the Charger concept car, like its predecessor, has a powerful V8 -- in this case, a supercharged 4.7-liter engine producing 325 horsepower. But instead of the gas-guzzling, pollution-belching engines of Chargers in the late 60's and early 70's, the show car has a superclean engine that runs on compressed natural gas, known as C.N.G. If the Charger were put into production, it would qualify as an ultra-low-emission vehicle in California.",
