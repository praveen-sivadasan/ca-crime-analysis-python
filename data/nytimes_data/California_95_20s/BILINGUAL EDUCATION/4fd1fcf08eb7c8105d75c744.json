    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Your June 14 front-page article on Ron K. Unz, the California millionaire who ''beat bilingual teaching,'' misses what was truly disturbing about his victory. As you say, he may represent a new kind of force on the California political scene who can change policy through narrowly focused initiatives, but he does not speak for, represent or lead a roused conservative population. No, Mr. Unz succeeds through apathy.",
