    "lead_paragraph": "If it's November, those must be sandhill cranes. That's the essence of a book about northern California by Bill McMillon, the newest in the \"Seasonal Guide to the Natural Year\" series by Fulcrum Publishing in Golden, Colo. The book breaks down the year into months, and gives tips on when and where to go to see, for example, migrating whales. A reader who wants to see sandhill cranes learns that they winter in the state's Central Valley, and that the best place to find them is in the Merced National Wildlife Refuge. The book costs $15.95 in major bookstores; it can also be ordered by calling (800) 992-2908.",
