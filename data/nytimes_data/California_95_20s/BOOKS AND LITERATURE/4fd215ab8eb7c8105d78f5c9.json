    "lead_paragraph": "COOKBOOK authors have tried all the angles. There are books dedicated to barbecue sauces, to Christmas in the Heartland, and even one on cooking ''unplugged,'' without the aid of electric appliances. Now, Michele Anna Jordan, who wrote an entire book on polenta (once a simple peasant dish made of cornmeal, water, salt, butter and cheese), has produced ''California Home Cooking'' (Harvard Common Press, $16.95). Home cooking by state is a fairly novel idea. But does such a thing exist? California spans 10 degrees of latitude, which means it has the climate to grow everything from heat-loving dates to cool-weather root vegetables. That doesn't make a cuisine, just lucky geography. ''California home cooking and California cuisine,'' Ms. Jordan writes, ''both proved to be very much what I always had thought they were: casual styles of cooking that unite several cuisines -- most importantly, Spanish, Mexican and Italian.''",
