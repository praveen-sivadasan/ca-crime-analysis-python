    "lead_paragraph": "An effort by two San Francisco-area academics to eliminate affirmative-action programs in California has set off a debate over civil rights that is rapidly spreading across the country and threatens to be one of the most divisive national dialogues in years. The two professors, Glynn Custred and Thomas Wood, who describe themselves as \"staunch conservatives,\" want the issue of affirmative action put to a popular vote in California sometime next year. It is an approach that poll takers and political analysts already say has a good chance of overturning the state's affirmative-action laws.",
