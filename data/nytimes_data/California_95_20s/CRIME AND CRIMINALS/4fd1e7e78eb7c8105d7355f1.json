    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: \"Strike One for 'Three Strikes' \" (editorial, April 4) mischaracterized California's tough new repeat-offender law as \"off to a shaky start.\" On the contrary, one year after Three Strikes was signed into law, crime is down substantially in California. Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, an early critic, admits that Three Strikes is at least partly responsible for the 6,223 fewer major crimes in his county in the first five months of 1994 compared with 1993.",
