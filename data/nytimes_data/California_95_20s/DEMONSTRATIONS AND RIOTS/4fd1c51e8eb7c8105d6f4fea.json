    "lead_paragraph": "The state has issued emergency regulations prohibiting guards from shooting prisoners to break up fist fights, a practice that has resulted in the killing of more than two dozen inmates since 1989. In the last five years, California prison guards killed three times as many inmates as were killed in all other state and Federal prisons combined, according to The Orange County Register, which today reported that the emergency regulations had been issued. At least 27 inmates were shot to death in California from 1989 to 1994, compared with 8 killed by guards throughout the rest of the nation.",
