    "lead_paragraph": "William Bergman knew how he wanted to die. ''He wanted to be free of pain,'' said his daughter, Beverly, ''and die at home with us.'' But when Mr. Bergman, an 85-year-old retired railroad detective from Hayward, Calif., contracted lung cancer last February, he got only half his wish. He died at home, his daughter said, but in miserable pain. To experts in end-of-life care, it is a familiar tale: an elderly patient dies in intractable pain. But Mr. Bergman's daughter has set out to give this old story a different ending and in the process has touched off an intense debate about how best to improve the treatment of the dying.",
    "abstract": "Some patient advocates are urging that doctors be more aggressive in using pain medicine to improve care of the dying; for decades, doctors have worried that they might be disciplined, or even face criminal prosecution, for aggressive use of morphine and other narcotics to control pain; now, some advocates are trying to swing pendulum in the other direction, by pressing authorities to punish doctors for not using pain medicine aggressively enough; Beverly Bergman files complaint against Medical Board of California, asking that her father's doctor be disciplined for failing to prescribe powerful narcotics that could have given relief to her father, who died of lung cancer in miserable pain; photo (M)",
