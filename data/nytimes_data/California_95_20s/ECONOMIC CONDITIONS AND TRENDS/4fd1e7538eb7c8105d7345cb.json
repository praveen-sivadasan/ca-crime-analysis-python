    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: \"Leaders in States Pledge to Reduce Taxes This Year\" (front page, Jan. 30) contains a flagrant error, which strongly prejudices the argument for Gov. Pete Wilson's 15 percent cut in California's personal and corporate income tax rates. You state that \"many are based on optimistic economic assumptions,\" and \"Gov.
