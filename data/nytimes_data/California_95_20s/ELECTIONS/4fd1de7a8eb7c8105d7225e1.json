    "lead_paragraph": "The Irwin Gertzog statistic about widows winning their deceased husband's seats 84 percent of the time, versus only 14 percent for other first-time female candidates, was somewhat misleading (''The Widow's Run,'' by Frank Bruni, March 29). Since a widow running for her late husband's seat is obviously campaigning for an open seat (that is, no incumbent involved), it would be more appropriate to compare this high 84 percent figure with one for women running for other open seats, which, according to a recent study by the National Women's Political Caucus, is 48 percent for United States House seats and slightly over 50 percent for state legislative seats. Mary Bono is 13 years younger than the average woman running for Congress but, like 83 percent of the women running, she has children and has been a homemaker. And she has, like many recent female candidates, run a small business.",
