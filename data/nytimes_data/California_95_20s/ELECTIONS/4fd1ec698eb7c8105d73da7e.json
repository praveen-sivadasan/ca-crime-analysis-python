    "lead_paragraph": "When Robert K. Dornan was a member of Congress, representing California's dependably Republican and conservative Orange County for the better part of two decades, he was not much given to Capitol Hill's special brand of civility, comity and convention. He was better known, instead, as the master of boastful bluster, the ad hominem assault and the blunt riposte. So two years ago when he got into political trouble in his home district, those Republicans who had felt his verbal sting once too often were not there to help. He was turned out of office by Loretta Sanchez, one of the growing number of moderate Democrats showing up in the district.",
