    "lead_paragraph": "For more than a decade, Representative George E. Brown Jr., an old-line liberal Democrat first elected to Congress in 1962, was a top target for Republicans eager to win a seat in California's sprawling ''Inland Empire'' of semi-desert suburbs and commuter communities. And more than once, Mr. Brown came close to losing, so when the Congressman died in July at 79 after complications from heart surgery, a close race to succeed him seemed all but inevitable. But for the moment, that close race is between two Democrats vying for their party's nomination in a special election on Sept. 21. And the contest, the first Congressional election of the 2000 cycle, says much about the changing demographics of a district where the first McDonald's drive-in opened in the years after World War II. Once a solid blue-collar steel-making center on the path of Route 66, the area became a beachhead of Reagan Republicanism, and in recent years there has been a steady rise in the influence of Hispanic voters, who are expected to exert growing power in California's politics in the coming years.",
