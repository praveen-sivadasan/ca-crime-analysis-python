    "lead_paragraph": "The first discovery came in August at Paradise Memorial Park, a cemetery in the working-class Los Angeles suburb of Santa Fe Springs, where visitors came upon a 10-foot-high mound of bones and splintered coffins. Then, at Lincoln Memorial Park, a rundown cemetery here in another suburb of Los Angeles, scores of discarded headstones were found in metal Dumpsters and in jumbled piles near a toolshed. In one instance, a tombstone was being used as a paperweight on a stack of telephone books in the cemetery office.",
