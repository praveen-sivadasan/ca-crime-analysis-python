    "lead_paragraph": "Think of it as the end of innocence for Silicon Valley. At 7:30 on a recent Monday morning some 30 chief executives and venture capitalists crowded into the boardroom of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Valley's most prestigious venture capital firm. The understated corporate decorum was marred only by a huge red and white ''No on Prop. 211'' banner hanging against the far wall.",
    "abstract": "Silicon Valley's top executives launch campaign to defeat California's Proposition 211, which would lower barrier to class-action lawsuits in cases where stock fraud is charged and would leave corporate directors and officers personally liable when juries award damages; lawyers pushing the proposition see it as way to defend savings of retirees from those who would lure them into high-flying, hard-crashing world of technology stocks, often with misinformation or inadequate disclosure of risk; but opponents see it as threat that could cripple nation's technology heartland; leader of campaign to defeat Proposition 211 is L John Doerr, venture capitalist who has history of nurturing technology start-ups that developed into entire new industries; photos (M)",
