    "lead_paragraph": "Furthering the trend toward consolidation in managed care, two big California providers, the Foundation Health Corporation and Health Systems International, announced what they called a merger of equals yesterday, in the process creating a $6.4 billion company with nearly five million members. Under the terms of the all-stock transaction, which the companies valued at approximately $3 billion, Foundation will merge and become a subsidiary of Health Systems, and Health Systems will change its name to Foundation Health Systems.",
    "abstract": "Foundation Health Corp and Health Systems International, two large managed care providers in California, announce what they call merger of equals; under terms of all-stock transaction, which companies value at about $3 billion, foundation will merge and become subsidiary of Health Systems, and Health Systems will change its name to Foundation Health Systems; analysts say merger makes sense, particularly in California, nation's most competitive market for managed health care services; merger was hastened by August alliance of FHP International Corp and Pacificare Health Systems, two other California companies; although called merger of equals, Health Systems would appear to be acquiring foundation; after serving for year as chairman of new entity, Daniel D Crowley, Foundation Health's chairman and chief executive, will step down and turn job over to Malik M Hasan, chief executive of Health Systems (M)",
