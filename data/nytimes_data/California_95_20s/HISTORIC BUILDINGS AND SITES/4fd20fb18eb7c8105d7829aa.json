Miller surveys the crumbling mortar and flaking brick, the jagged six-inch cracks and the scars of swallows' nests dotting the underside of a sagging stone dome, and marvels aloud, ''You wonder what the hell is holding this up.'' Quickly and ruefully, he answers himself, ''It's held up by faith alone.''

For the last six years, this former investment banker has overseen an ambitious conservation plan budgeted at almost $10 million and aimed at stabilizing and preserving the remnants of the mission's Great Stone Church, which was finished in 1806 and destroyed just six years later by an earthquake that killed 40 worshipers in the middle of a morning Mass.",
