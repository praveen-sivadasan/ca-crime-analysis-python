    "lead_paragraph": "A ring suspected of fixing races at California thoroughbred tracks is part of an F.B.I. and state investigation that includes the case of a top jockey who died mysteriously in 1993. The investigation includes an August 1996 race at Bay Meadows in San Mateo that was allegedly fixed in an effort to win at least $280,000 at Nevada casinos, believed to be the largest trifecta payout in the state's history. The same ring also made bets on that race at casinos as far away as Jamaica, winning an unknown amount of money.",
