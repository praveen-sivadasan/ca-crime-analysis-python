    "lead_paragraph": "Diving into social issues he had avoided for most of this campaign, Bob Dole today asserted that President Clinton had bowed to ''militant special interests'' in fighting efforts to ''guard this nation's borders.'' Mr. Dole assailed Mr. Clinton for fighting efforts to cut government medical care for illegal immigrants with AIDS and to bar children of illegal immigrants from public schools. Mr. Dole's decision to focus on immigration issues came in a wide and generally fierce attack on Mr. Clinton during a swing through Southern California. Mr. Dole intensified the assault on Mr. Clinton's fitness that he raised in their debate on Wednesday, suggesting today that the Democratic Party had laundered illicit campaign contributions and alluding to Mr. Clinton's effort to avoid service in Vietnam.",
