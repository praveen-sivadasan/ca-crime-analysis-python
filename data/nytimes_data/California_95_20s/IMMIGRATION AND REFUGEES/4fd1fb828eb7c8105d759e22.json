    "lead_paragraph": "For more than a century, the Gold Rush of 1849 defined the Golden State, capturing in its rush for riches the eternal optimism that drew generations of adventurers to California. But as California embarks on three years of 150th anniversaries -- the discovery of gold in 1848, the writing of California's bilingual Constitution in 1849, and statehood in 1850 -- the boosterism of earlier celebrations is gone.",
    "abstract": "Californians are less than totally celebratory as they begin marking 150th anniversaries of discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848, writing of California's bilingual Constitution in 1849 and statehood in 1850; are mindful of state's battles over immigration, affirmative action and environmental costs of development; near annihilation of California's Indians, oppression of blacks and Chinese and environmental destruction that still scars northern sections of state are weighed against 'forty-niner' exploits; photos (M)",
