    "lead_paragraph": "The jockey COREY NAKATANI, under investigation by the California Horse Racing Board for supposedly whipping a horse past the finish line, said he did nothing wrong and acted professionally. The horse, Tillie's Joy, broke down following the sixth race at Santa Anita last Friday. The 2-year-old colt suffered a complete fracture of the cannon bone in his left foreleg and had to be destroyed. \"I conducted myself professionally,\" Nakatani said Wednesday. \"I didn't strike the horse out of anger.\" (AP)",
