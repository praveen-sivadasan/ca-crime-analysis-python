    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Re California's proposal for ''chemical castration'' of child molesters (front page, Aug. 27): No one doubts that an individual who preys on children in such a barbarous manner is a monster. However, these people are human beings. Forced sterilization will not solve the problem, but it will push this society toward an even more punitive justice. Let us not forget the forced sterilizations in Nazi Germany and the eugenics movement and the sterilization of criminals in several states here in the early part of this century.",
