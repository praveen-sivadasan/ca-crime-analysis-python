    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Tobacco smoke would return to many more restaurants than taverns if California's new bar-smoking law is repealed (news article, Jan. 30). Most news reports refer to 35,000 affected ''bars,'' but more than 30,000 of these liquor licenses are held by eating establishments. Smoking in restaurants, and almost all other California workplaces, has been prohibited since 1995. But only starting Jan. 1 did that law apply to taverns and to restaurants' bar areas. Before that, smoke from bars polluted the air in adjacent dining areas, and food service in bars created unfair competition with restaurants lacking a bar.",
