    "lead_paragraph": "The mother of a young boy who died from untreated diabetes, and the Christian Science practitioners who administered prayer rather than insulin as the 11-year-old slipped into a coma, failed today to persuade the Supreme Court to hear their appeal of a $1.5 million damage judgment won in a lawsuit by the boy's father. The appeal, from a 1995 ruling by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, presented the case as an urgent issue of religious freedom, with an importance to Christian Scientists that \"can scarcely be overstated,\" according to the petition filed on behalf of four people: the mother, her son's stepfather, the Christian Science practitioner who prayed from his own home and the Christian Science nurse who came to the family's house and kept detailed notes of the boy's rapidly deteriorating condition without summoning outside help. The boy's parents were divorced.",
