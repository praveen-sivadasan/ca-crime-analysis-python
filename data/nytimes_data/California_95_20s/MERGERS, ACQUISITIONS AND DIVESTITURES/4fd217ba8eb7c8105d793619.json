    "lead_paragraph": "Colony Capital Inc. and the developer Michael Swerdlow said yesterday that they had bought the Great Mall of the Bay Area, the largest shopping mall in Northern California, for $130 million. The two teamed up to buy the 1.5-million-square-foot mall in Milpitas, Calif., from the real estate unit of the Ford Motor Company. The property operates as a factory outlet center, selling clothes and other goods directly from 185 manufacturers and retailers at discounted prices. Preliminary plans call for Mr. Swerdlow, who is based in Miami, and Colony, a Los Angeles-based real estate investor, to spend more than $25 million adding entertainment-type tenants to the mall.",
