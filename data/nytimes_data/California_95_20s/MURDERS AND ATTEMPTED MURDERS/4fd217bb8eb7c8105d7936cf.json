    "abstract": "California is holding special competency trial to decide whether Horace Kelley, who is scheduled to be executed for killing two women and 11-year-old boy in 1984, has become too incompetent during years on death row to be put to death; mental competency threshold that inmate must meet before being wheeled into death chamber is so low that capital punishment experts recall only three or four cases of execution being stopped because hearing concluded that condemned man had grown too imcompetent; photo (M)",
