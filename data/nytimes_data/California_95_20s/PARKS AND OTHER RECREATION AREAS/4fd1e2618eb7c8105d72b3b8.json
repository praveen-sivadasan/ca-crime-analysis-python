    "lead_paragraph": "The National Park Service has recently taken control of Manzanar National Historic Site, the internment camp in eastern California halfway between Los Angeles and Reno, where up to 10,000 people of Japanese ancestry were held during World War II. The transfer of management brought with it a number of planned improvements, none of which are yet financed, for the 800-acre site. All that is left of the internment camp -- the best preserved of the 10 war relocation centers in the United States -- is a rickety auditorium, stone sentry posts, dusty streets, a rock garden and the foundations of barracks where Japanese-Americans and Japanese citizens lived from 1942 to 1945. The Park Service wants to turn the auditorium into an interpretive center for visitors, and restore some of the living quarters, guard towers and barbed-wire fence to their World War II conditions.",
