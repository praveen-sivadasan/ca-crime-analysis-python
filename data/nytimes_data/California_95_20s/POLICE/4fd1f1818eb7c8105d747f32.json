    "lead_paragraph": "A type of tear gas made from cayenne peppers is not a benign police tool but a potential killer, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California said today in a report on pepper spray. The report said that as of the end of May, 26 people who had been sprayed with the liquid had died in police custody in California. These deaths had occurred since October 1992 when the Attorney General, Dan Lungren, allowed law-enforcement officers to use pepper spray. That three-year approval expires in August, and can be renewed by Mr. Lungren.",
