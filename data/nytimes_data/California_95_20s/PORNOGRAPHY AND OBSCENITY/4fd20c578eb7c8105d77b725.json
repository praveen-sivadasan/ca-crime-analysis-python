    "lead_paragraph": "The constitutional protection against double jeopardy does not ordinarily apply to criminal sentencing, the Supreme Court ruled today in a decision that removed a legal cloud from the operation of some states' ''three strikes'' sentencing laws. The 5-to-4 decision, upholding a ruling by the California Supreme Court, means that a state can have more than one chance to prove that a previous conviction qualifies as a ''strike'' that counts against a defendant in calculating an enhanced sentence for a new offense.",
