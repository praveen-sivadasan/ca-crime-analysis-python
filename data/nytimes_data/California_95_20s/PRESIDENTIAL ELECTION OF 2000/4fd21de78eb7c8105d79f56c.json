    "lead_paragraph": "As Vice President, Al Gore has traveled to California so many times that aides have lost count. They think his latest trip this weekend, his second of the year already, is the 52d. But they are not eager to bet on it. While the exact number does not matter much, what Mr. Gore has done there behind the scenes probably does. Over the last three years, he has built a prodigious network of constituent groups and contributors to help him win California's 54 electoral votes, the most of any state, and help him become the fifth incumbent Vice President to capture the White House by election. (The others were John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren and George Bush.)",
