    "lead_paragraph": "A SIMPLE facelift wouldn't have been enough for prunes. This ubiquitous dried fruit, long a favorite of the over-65 generation, needed a name change to create a more youthful image and to appeal to shoppers, especially women, in the 35-to-50 age range. ''They thought of prunes as something their parents ate,'' said Richard Peterson, executive director of the California Prune Board, noting that prune sales were flat in that younger group. So the board petitioned the Food and Drug Administration for permission to use the term ''dried plums'' as an alternative to prunes on packages of the fruit.",
