    "lead_paragraph": "A Federal judge today blocked enforcement of Proposition 209, the newly passed California citizen initiative that prohibits the use of race and sexual preferences in state-run affirmative action programs. He said there was a ''strong probability'' that it might be unconstitutional. The action, in a temporary restraining order, was handed down by Chief Judge Thelton E. Henderson in United States District Court in San Francisco. It was a stinging blow to the opponents of affirmative action who rejoiced on Election Day when the hotly disputed proposition was approved by almost 55 percent of the state's voters.",
    "abstract": "Federal Judge Thelton E Henderson issues temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of Proposition 209, newly passed California citizen initiative that prohibits use of race and sexual preferences in state-run affirmative action programs; Gov Pete Wilson calls ruling 'absurd' and says will of voters ultimately will prevail; restraining order, issued at request of coalition of civil rights groups, will be in effect until Dec 16, when both parties in dispute will return to court to argue over whether order should be lifted or extended until constitutionality of Proposition 209 can be decided at trial (M)",
