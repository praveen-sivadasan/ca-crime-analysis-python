    "lead_paragraph": "Californians today approved a ballot measure that would curtail three decades of bilingual instruction in the public schools here, paving the way for similar assaults on such programs around the nation, according to early election returns. Strong majorities across major ethnic and racial lines expressed support in pre-election public opinion polls for the measure to effectively end bilingual education, though most Hispanic elected officials and all the major candidates for governor in both parties opposed it.",
    "abstract": "Early election returns show Californians have approved measure to effectively end bilingual education in public schools, paving way for similar assaults on such programs around nation; Ron K Unz sponsored measure; Lt Gov Gray Davis wins Democratic nomination for governor, defeating Rep Jane Harman and Alfred A Checchi; will oppose Atty Gen Dan Lungren, who faces token opposition in state's new blanket primary in which names of all candidates appear on same ballot regardless of party; race between State Treas Matt Fong and Darrell Issa for Republican nomination for United States Senate remains too close to call, as does fight over ballot measure that would require unions to get written consent from members to use dues for political purposes; photo (M)",
