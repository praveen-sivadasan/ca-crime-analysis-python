    "lead_paragraph": "California's habitual-offender law is off to a shaky start. The law, dubbed \"Three Strikes and You're Out,\" requires anyone convicted of three felonies, including one violent crime, to serve 25 years to life in prison. The perverse result is that defendants up for their third felony in Los Angeles are refusing to plea-bargain for sentences, thus clogging the courts with expensive, time-consuming trials. Prosecutors in Los Angeles fear they may have to drop misdemeanor prosecutions, the kind of low-level street crime that, while usually nonviolent, harms the quality of city life. Civil suits are already in holding patterns so that the strikeout criminal docket can be served.",
