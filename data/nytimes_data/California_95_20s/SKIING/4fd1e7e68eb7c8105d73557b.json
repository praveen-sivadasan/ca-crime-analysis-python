    "lead_paragraph": "Skiing in July usually means the Andes. But this year, Squaw Valley U.S.A. and Alpine Meadows, two California mountain resorts, plan to stay open until July 4, thanks to recent heavy snow. Although Squaw Valley's daily adult lift ticket is still $43, it now includes night skiing, skating and use of the resort's lagoon and spa. Starting May 1, when only the upper mountain will be open, the lift ticket will drop to $28. The night skiing and other extras will not be included. Alpine Meadows will reduce rates as more trails close down. For Squaw Valley information, call (916) 583-6985; ski conditions, (916) 583-6955; reservations, (800) 545-4350. For Alpine Meadows, call (916) 583-4232.",
