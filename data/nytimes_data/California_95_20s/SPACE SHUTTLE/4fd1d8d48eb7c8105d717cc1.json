    "lead_paragraph": "NASA selected the Lockheed Martin Corporation today to build a futuristic experimental rocket that could lead to drastic cuts in the cost of putting payloads into space. The wedge-shaped re-usable vehicle, the X-33, will be the first major new spacecraft built by the United States in 25 years. It is a step toward replacing the space shuttle, and will be built under a program intended to move much of the initiative for developing high-risk technologies out of NASA's hands and into those of private industry.",
