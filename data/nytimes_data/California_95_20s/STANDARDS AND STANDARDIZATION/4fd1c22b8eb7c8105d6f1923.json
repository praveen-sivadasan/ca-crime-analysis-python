    "lead_paragraph": "THE Detroit auto makers will soon be selling electric cars in California, and Ford, Chrysler and General Motors say they want a common standard for how the cars plug in for recharging, just as their gasoline-powered cars have standard-sized filler pipes that accept standardized gasoline nozzles. But an old-fashioned rivalry threatens to complicate the market even as it struggles to be born. General Motors, which has the most experience of the three with electric vehicles, designed its EV1 -- formerly known as the Impact -- with an inductive charger, which transmits energy in the form of an alternating magnetic current. The current comes out of a paddle that looks as if it came from a Ping-Pong table. The driver slips the paddle into a slot on the front of the car.",
