    "lead_paragraph": "An article on July 16 about a Federal judge's refusal to block the statewide ballot measure that ended most bilingual education programs in the California public schools referred incorrectly to the role of the state Attorney General, Dan Lungren. Mr. Lungren has not recused himself or the Attorney General's office in the lawsuit challenging the measure. The State Board of Education, which is defending the measure, retained its own lawyers with the Attorney General's permission because it wanted to advance different legal arguments.",
