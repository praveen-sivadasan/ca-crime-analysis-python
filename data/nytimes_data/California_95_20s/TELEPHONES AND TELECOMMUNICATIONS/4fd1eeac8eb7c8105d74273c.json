    "lead_paragraph": "The AT&T Corporation announced its first significant foray into the local telephone business yesterday. But the modest scope of its two new services underscored that AT&T was tiptoeing into this $100 billion market, even a year after it was thrown open to competition. Starting on Feb. 3, AT&T said it would offer local phone service to small- and medium-size business customers in California. The long-distance carrier will not build its own local operations but will lease lines on the existing local network of Pacific Telesis Group.",
    "abstract": "AT&T Corp sets modest foray into local phone business; will offer service to small- and medium-size business customers in California, leasing lines from Pacific Telesis Group; will offer to handle local outgoing calls for large business customers in 35 states that have dedicated lines connecting their offices to AT&T's long-distance network; analysts say plans are less ambitious than those of MCI Communications (M)",
