Kaczynski is the Unabomber and if he is, whether he should be put to death expressed conservative attitudes that seemed to reflect those of the small towns and midsized cities of this region. Nine women and three men were selected as jurors today, after more than a month of jury selection.",
    "abstract": "Jury is picked in Sacramento to hear case against accused Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski; panel, including nine women, will remain anonymous and is drawn from wide swath of northern California not including San Francisco area; pool is considered much more conservative than one in Newark, NJ, where Kaczynski is also charged; start of trial is delayed by Judge Garland Burrell's private meeting with defense (S)",
