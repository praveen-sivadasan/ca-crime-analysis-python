    "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Marc Reisner's description of Representative John Doolittle's love affair with the Auburn Dam (\"Concrete for America? Count Him In!\" Op-Ed, Aug. 20) may have left the impression that the dam would create recreation benefits. Mr. Doolittle hints at this, but nothing could be further from the truth. The reservoir would fluctuate hundreds of feet each year, making it virtually unusable by recreationists. The canyons it would inundate are already used by nearly a million visitors a year. They are one of the most popular recreation areas in central California. GERALD H. MERAL Sacramento, Calif., Aug. 21, 1995 The writer is former deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources.",
