    "lead_paragraph": "THIS was a fascinating year in the wine business. And not just because the grape harvest was so good in so many places. It was a year of consolidation and new directions, a year that may even lead to cheaper prices. It was a year of silver anniversaries, too; a lot of people decided to become winemakers in 1972. A good harvest means good wine, of course, and it also sets the tone for the year. It fosters optimism in a business that really can't do without it.",
