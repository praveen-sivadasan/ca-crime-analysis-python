    "lead_paragraph": "THE $100 bottle of California cabernet sauvignon, while hardly commonplace, is no longer the exotic rarity it was a few years ago. As a group, the cabernets are now the most expensive wines California has ever produced. A few devil-may-care grape-squeezers have already vaulted well over the $100 barrier. At Diamond Creek Vineyards in the Napa Valley, Al Brounstein, the owner, has priced his 1994 Lake Vineyard cabernet at $250 a bottle. Diamond Creek is an 80-acre estate on the steep rugged side of Diamond Mountain, near Calistoga. There are four separate vineyard blocks -- Volcanic Hill, Gravelly Meadow, Red Rock Terrace and Lake Vineyard, which is a one-acre parcel. The first three are fermented and bottled separately each year.",
