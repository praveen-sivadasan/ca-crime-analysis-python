    "lead_paragraph": "In the end, it looked as if opponents of the two most controversial, closely watched initiatives on the state ballot never had a chance. Californians overwhelmingly approved a ban on the recognition of same-sex marriages, as well as a laundry list of laws that stiffen penalties for adolescent offenders and make it easier to try youths as adults.",
    "abstract": "California voters overwhelmingly approve controversial initiatives to ban recognition of same-sex marriages and to stiffen penalties for adolescent offenders and make it easier to try youths as adults; crime measure passes 62 percent to 38 percent, despite steady drop in crime in last 10 years; marriage measure passes 61.4 percent to 38.6 percent; both get broad support from men and women and all races and income levels; voters also approve initiatives extending death penalty to arson and kidnapping cases and increasing penalty for second-degree murder of BART police officer or California State University peace officer to life in prison; photo (M)",
